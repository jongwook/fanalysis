$$f (x) = arctan (x)$$, where $$X = Y = \mathbb{R}$$ and $$T_X, T_Y$$ are the usual topology on $$\mathbb{R}$$,&nbsp;maps a closed set $$\mathbb{R}$$ to an open set $$]-\frac \pi 2 , \frac \pi 2[$$.
<br>
<br>For the additional points, when $$X = \mathbb{R}$$ with the usual topology $$T_X$$ and $$Y = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 | x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 = 1\}$$ with the topology $$T_Y$$ induced from the usual topology of $$\mathbb{R}^2$$, $$f(x) = (sin(x), cos(x))$$ maps
a closed set $$[0, 2 \pi]$$ in $$\mathbb{R}$$ to an open set $$Y$$ in $$Y$$.
