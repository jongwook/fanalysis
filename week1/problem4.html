$$(\Rightarrow)$$
<br>Suppose that $$(X,T)$$ is a $$T_3$$-space. For any $$x \in (X, T)$$ and its neighborhood $$U$$,
<br>by definition of neighborhood, there exists an open set $$V \subset U$$ such that $$x \in V$$.&nbsp;
<br>Then $$V^c$$ is a closed set which does not contain $$x$$ and since $$(X, T)$$ is a $$T_3$$ space,
<br>there exists disjoint open sets $$V_1$$, $$V_2$$ such that $$x \in V_1$$ and $$V^c \subset V_2$$, or equivalently $$V_2^c \subset V$$.
<br>Since $$V_1$$ and $$V_2$$ are disjoint, we have $$V_1 \subset V_2^c$$, which gives us $$x \in V_1 \subset V_2^c \subset V \subset U$$.
<br>$$V_2^c$$ is a closed subset of $$U$$, therefore we have found the smaller neighborhood : $$x \in V_2^c = \overline{V_2^c} \subset U$$.
<br>
<br>$$(\Leftarrow)$$
<br>Suppose that $$\forall x \in (X,T) \; \forall U \in \mathcal{V}(x) \; \exists O \in \mathcal{V}(x) \; \mathrm{s.t.} \; x \in \overline{O} \subset U$$.
<br>For any $$x \in (X, T)$$ and a closed set $$M \subset X$$ which doesn't contain $$x$$, $$M^c$$ is a neighborhood of $$x$$,
<br>so there exists a smaller neighborhood $$O$$ of $$x$$ such that $$x \in \overline{O} \subset M^c$$.
<br>Now we have $$x \in O$$ and $$M \subset \overline{O}^c$$ which are two disjoint neighborhood of $$x$$ and $$M$$, therefore $$(X, T)$$ is $$T_3$$.
