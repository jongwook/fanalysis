For any $$f$$ in $$C([0, 1])$$ and any $$a \in \mathbb{R}$$, $$]a, +\infty[$$ is an open set in $$\mathbb{R}$$ and since $$f$$ is continuous,<br>$$f^{-1} (]a, +\infty[)$$ is an open set in $$[0, 1]$$ equipped with the usual topology, which means it can be constructed by&nbsp;<br><ul><li>Start from open intervals on $$[0, 1]$$, all of which are basic sets and thus Lebesgue measurable</li><li>Add sets obtained by taking any finite intersections on those sets, all of which are still&nbsp;Lebesgue&nbsp;measurable thanks to the property of $$\sigma$$-algebra</li><li>Add sets obtained by taking any union on those sets, which can be rewritten as a finite union of those sets since $$[0, 1]$$ is compact, and then we can apply the property of $$\sigma$$-algebra to see that all of them are still measurable.</li></ul>Therefore&nbsp;$$f^{-1} (]a, +\infty[)$$ is measurable, and by definition $$f$$ is a measurable function, i.e., $$f \in L^1([0, 1])$$.<br><br>$$ \therefore C([0, 1]) \subset L^1([0, 1])$$
