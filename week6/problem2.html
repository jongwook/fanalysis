Since $$(L^1)^*$$ is $$L^\infty$$, the natural homomorphism $$J$$ from $$L^1$$ into its double dual $$(L^1)^{**} = (L^\infty)^*$$ implies that $$L^1 \subset&nbsp;L^\infty$$. Now it suffices to show that $$(L^\infty) \neq L^1$$.<br><br>Let $$W$$ be the subspace of $$L^\infty$$ composed of continuous functions. For $$f \in W \subset L^\infty$$ define the operator $$T$$ as&nbsp;$$T(f) = f(0) $$, then $$T$$ is continuous since $$|T(f)| = |f(0)| \leq | \sup f | = \| f \|_{L^\infty}$$.<br><br>By Hahn-Banach theorem $$T$$ can be extended to a continuous linear operator on the whole space: $$T: L^{\infty} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$.<br><br>Let $$J$$ denote the natural homomorphism from $$L^1$$ into $$L^\infty$$: $$J(f)(\xi) = \xi(f)$$, and suppose that $$T = J(f)$$ for some $$f \in L^1$$, which means that $$T$$ can be represented as<br><br>$$T(g) = \int f \cdot g$$<br><br>for some $$f \in L^1$$, so we have $$\int f \cdot g = g(0)$$ for continuous and bounded $$g$$.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, for any Lebesgue point $$x_0 \neq 0$$ and $$\epsilon &lt; |x_0|$$ there exists a sequence of continuous functions $$g_k$$ with $$[x_0 - \epsilon , x_0 + \epsilon]$$ support, which converges to $$\mathbb{1} _{[x_0 - \epsilon , x_0 + \epsilon]}$$ where $$ \mathbb{1} $$ denotes the characteristic function. Using that $$g_k(0) = 0$$ since $$0 \notin&nbsp;[x_0 - \epsilon , x_0 + \epsilon]$$,<br><br>$$0 = \frac 1 {2 \epsilon} \int_{x_0 - \epsilon}^{x_0 + \epsilon} f \cdot g_k \rightarrow \frac 1 { 2 \epsilon} \int_{x_0 - \epsilon}^{x_0 + \epsilon} f(x) dx $$.<br><br>Since $$ x_{0} $$ is a Lebesgue point, the latter integral must converge to $$f(x_0)$$, which means that $$f = 0$$ almost everywhere. This implies $$T = 0$$ which is a contradiction.&nbsp;<br><br>We have found $$T \in (L^\infty)^*$$ and $$T \notin L^1$$, therefore,&nbsp;$$L^1$$&nbsp;âŠŠ&nbsp;$$(L^\infty)^{*} $$.<br><br>
